# Rep Buddy
Done for HackUMBC Spring 2016

This is a Fitness App built using the Corona SDK that tracks repetitions for pushups, pullups, chinups, and crunches. The user inputs their desired number of sets and reps for pushups, the time they would like to hold each position, and how long they want to rest between sets.

After the user inputs this information, the app counts down an adjustable ammount of time to give the user time to put their phone on their back or in their pocket and get in the desired position. The app then informs the user on when to move up or down, and counts out the hold time after the user has done so. It detects that they have actually done the movement by reading accelerometer data. It also counts down the users rest time between sets, keeping their form and timing in check. 

At the end of the exercise session, the app displays a summary of the session including the number of reps done, the number of sets done, and the number of calories burned.
